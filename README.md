# David François | Bio-IT Architect & Bioinformatics Engineer 🥭🧬

### Engineering Trust in Biological Data Pipelines

I specialize in the intersection of **Genomic Integrity** and **Distributed Systems**. My work focuses on building immutable ledgers for agricultural data, containerized bio-informatics pipelines, and low-friction field-to-cloud gateways.

### 🛠 Technical Ecosystem
- **Bio-Informatics:** DNA sequence analysis (GC-Content), Pathogen Resilience profiling, and Genomic Notarization.
- **Data Engineering:** Designing secure data pipelines using Python, SHA-256 Hashing, and Twilio API.
- **DevOps & Cloud:** Docker (Containerization), GitHub Actions (CI/CD), and Streamlit Cloud deployment.
- **Full-Stack Bio-IT:** Bridging "Last Mile" field data (WhatsApp/Twilio) with enterprise-grade research dashboards.

### 🚀 Featured Engineering Projects

#### [Bio-Estate: The Trilogy of Trust](https://github.com/francefarms/bio-estate)
A commercial-grade Bio-IT platform for secured agricultural asset management.
- **The Ledger:** Built a cryptographic SHA-256 hashing engine to ensure DNA sequence immutability.
- **The Gateway:** Integrated Twilio API to allow real-time WhatsApp-to-Cloud data entry for field scientists.
- **The Analysis:** Automated GC-content diagnostics for rapid pathogen screening.

#### [France Farms Infrastructure](https://github.com/francefarms/francefarms.github.io)
The public-facing portal for precision agriculture protocols and Bio-IT integration.
